# Motion-Tracking
Computer Vision - A package that detects motion in videos.
Uses the box() function to create a box around the moving object in a video.  It uses the parameters source, which is the videofile/videostream; newfile, which is the file the video with the box will save to; fps, which is how fast the saved video will play; and sensitivity, which is how sensitive the code is to motion.
